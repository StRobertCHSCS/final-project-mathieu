## 1. Objective of the game
![Alt text](https://i.imgur.com/yOodX9p.gif)
Tappy Tunnel is a game in which the player must hit the space bar to cause the playerâ€™s character, the green pipe,
to move upwards and upon releasing the player's character will fall due to the gravity created in the game . The player must navigate the pipe through a series of openings between the flappy birds.
Colliding with or getting near a bird flying towards results in a game over.

## 2. Game instruction
Tappy Tunnel does not contain any microtransactions or variations in difficulty. For the player to navigate the bird through
the pipes they must time their space bar taps so as not to rise high enough to hit the top bird and so as not to fall low enough to 
hit the bottom bird.
