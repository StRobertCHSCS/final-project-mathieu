# Final Project - Flappy bird
## 1. Objective of the game
Flappy Bird is a game in which the player must hit the space bar to cause the playerâ€™s character, the eponymous flappy bird,
to flap its wings and move upwards. The player must navigate the bird through a series of openings between pipes.
Colliding with or getting near a pipe results in a game over.

## 2. Game instruction
Flappy Bird does not contain any microtransactions or variations in difficulty. For the player to navigate the bird through
the pipes they must time their taps so as not to rise high enough to hit the top pipe and so as not to fall low enough to 
hit the bottom pipe.
